Social Group Simulation
1. Group social force is integrated into the social force model.    
2. Opinion dynamics is modeled, or often considered as herding effect.   

This is a simplified version of crowd simulation where no egress flow fields are calculated. 
The program is similar to CrowdEgress only for solver=0, and no doors are defined in order to simplify the computational process and highlight the important features of group social force and opinion models.
